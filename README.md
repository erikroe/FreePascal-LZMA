This repository is a copy of [Alan Birtles’ Pascal LZMA SDK](http://www.birtles.org.uk/programming/), which is based on [7zip’s LZMA SDK](https://7-zip.org/sdk.html) and ported over to Free Pascal.

This uploaded code contains a little bug fix which allows the code to properly work on x86 64bit compilation targets.
